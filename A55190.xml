            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN Advertiſement TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Think it neceſſary in this place to give the World a ſhort Account of ſome things relating to my ſelf, to avoid ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſiniſter Conſtructions, having now (and not till now) found a fit opportunity after my Forty five years Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, to ſatisfie Enquirers by giving them the reaſons of my ſo long and voluntary Exile, wherein I ſhall be as brief as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The Name and Family of the <hi>Plunkets</hi> are not
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Originally, but deſcended from the <hi>Romans,</hi> but have been in <hi>Ireland</hi> almoſt a thouſand years. My Father was of the Houſe of <hi>Dunſaney</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Meath,</hi> and brought up in the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion until to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when about the age of fourteen years, he came off from Popery, and became a zealous Proteſtant, and ſo continued till death; and becauſe he was the firſt of our Name that turn'd Proteſtant, he was therefore extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated by many great Papiſts, and all their Clergy, ſo that they waited an opportunity to do him ſome miſchief one way or other; and at laſt they found one, for a little before the Rebellion in 1641,
<pb facs="tcp:61958:6"/> he fell ſick, and in that his ſickneſs a Popiſh Phyſician poiſon'd him; fearing (as being a man of a great ſpirit) he might (as he would have done) by his repute and intereſt in the Country, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their deſigns thereabouts. And the ſaid Phyſitian confeſs'd upon his Death-bed that he poiſon'd him for no other cauſe but his being a Proteſtant; and that he was put upon it by others. And at the beginning of the Rebellion the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Plunder'd and burnt our Houſe, whereby nine Orphans of us were expos'd to great hardſhips and miſeries, as well as many thouſands more. My Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had an Eſtate left him by the Lord <hi>Dunſaney,</hi> whoſe ſecond Son he was; but betwixt him and my Father, partly by Gaming, but moſtly by engaging for others, all the Eſtate was gone. As ſoon as I heard (being then at
<hi>Dublin</hi>) what bloody work the <hi>Papiſts</hi> made in the Country, by murthering the Proteſtants, I reſolved to oppoſe and fight againſt them to the utmoſt of my power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Liſted my ſelf in Sir
<hi>Charles Coot</hi>'s Regiment, then ſixteen years of Age, and continued in the Wars until the Ceſſation made with the Rebels by the King's Order; whereupon about 8000. that fought ſucceſsfully againſt the Rebels, were ſent for by the King to fight for him in <hi>England,</hi> after which they never had ſucceſs, but were always worſted.</p>
            <p>After my Father's death, I found I was not only very much ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and neglected by my Proteſtant Kindred, but hated and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by my Popiſh Kindred, for fighting againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I was by other young Rebels; therefore to be no longer vext and griev'd with the unkindneſs of the one, and to avoid the danger of the other (whoſe malice I had but too much cauſe to fear) I reſolved upon a voluntary Baniſhment, for at leaſt twenty years (if I lived ſo long) and away came I with the Army (in Colonel <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s Regiment) in <hi>November</hi> 1643. Which Army at the Siege of <hi>Nantwich,</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:61958:6"/> routed by <hi>Fairfax</hi> the <hi>January</hi> following, where Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> (ſince Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>) with many others were taken, and ſent up to the Parliament. And while I was in thoſe parts, a Report being ſpread abroad (which was too true) that the King had many thouſands of Papiſts in his Armies, and that in one of them were 6000. This as it very much offended me, ſo it begat ſome thoughts in me of going to the Parliaments ſide, being alſo informed that they allow'd no <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Army (which was true). But while I was muſing what to do, ſome other Regiments came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the King, among which were many of my former Threatners, this rais'd in me a firm reſolution, to Liſt my ſelf in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Army, which I did ſoon after; and to eſcape the bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of thoſe Threatners above ſaid, and other ſuch in time to come, as alſo to perplex my moſt unkind Kindred with a twenty or thirty years ſilence, in which time I vow'd they ſhould neither ſee me, nor hear from me, I changed my own name, and went by the name of <hi>Clark,</hi> and have hitherto, and was in many Fights and Skirmiſhes in the North of <hi>England,</hi> and at the great Battel on
<hi>Marſton-Moor</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1644. And when Sir <hi>T. Fairfax</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, was made General of that Victorious Army call'd the <hi>New Model</hi> 1645. I Liſted my ſelf in his own Regiment of Foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I continued fifteen years, during which time divers Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not who I was, concluded me to be of ſome baſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, beggarly Parentage, for which I have been ſcorned and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them, and others all along; and when I ſaw what great Changes and Alterations were in hand in the beginning of the Year 1660. in reference to things and perſons, tending to a total ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Intereſt and Cauſe, which I had ſo zealouſly owned, and engaged in from firſt to laſt, I could not in judgment and conſcience recede from them, or any my former principles, by complying either
<pb facs="tcp:61958:7"/> to keep or get a place (as many Officers did) whereby I ſhould have beſpattered my Reputation (more dear to me than my life) and incurr'd that (to me) odious name of a Time-ſerver; whereupon I threw up my Commiſſion, and broke my Sword (loſing all my Arreers, and much Money lent my Company) and ſo retired from all publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ever ſince. For it ſhall never be ſaid, That a <hi>Plunket</hi> was falſe or guilty of any baſe unworthy treacherous Action for me; from which I have (by the Grace of God) kept my ſelf clear at all times, eſpecially theſe 29. years laſt paſt, wherein I have ſuffered many hard things for my integrity, being forced through the malice of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Mayors, Informers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to change my Dwellings fifteen times in twenty years. And as I loſt all in <hi>Ireland</hi> for being a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſo I loſt all again in <hi>England,</hi> for being a Diſſenter. But I am ſtill
<hi>ſemper idem,</hi> and reſolve to be whileſt I live, come what will of it. And though many hundreds (dead and alive) know what I was, and am, yet no man or woman knew who I was, till of late years.</p>

               <l>Then, good Commanders would be priz'd indeed,</l>
               <l>For they are precious in a time of need.</l>

                  <head>THE CHARACTER OF A Good Commander.</head>
                  <lg>
                     <l>A Valiant, Wiſe Commander is a prize</l>
                     <l>Hard to be found amongſt the vulgar ſize.</l>
                     <l>He bears a Generous, Vertuous, Noble Mind,</l>
                     <l>In whom (in all conditions) you ſhall find</l>
                     <l>All the parts of a Gentleman; for he</l>
                     <l>In Generoſity, Civility,</l>
                     <l>Juſtice, Humanity, Humility,</l>
                     <l>And Courteſy, ev'n to his Enemy;</l>
                     <l>Alſo in many other worthy deeds,</l>
                     <l>Moſt Men and Gallants of the time exceeds;</l>
                     <l>Therefore the Muſes do Record his Name,</l>
                     <l>And with his Vertues fill the Trump't of Fame.</l>
                     <l>He's one of a great Spirit, courage high,</l>
                     <l>Stands at a pinch, when others faint and fly.</l>
                     <l>He ſaith not to his Souldiers, go, but, come;</l>
                     <l>And 'mongſt the Armed Squadrons maketh room.</l>
                     <l>He's the Atlas of a Commonwealth, for He</l>
                     <l>Bears Heav'n up with his Shoulders conſtantly;</l>
                     <l>That is, with Temp'ral Power, he defends</l>
                     <l>Religion, Chriſt's Kingdom, and his Friends.</l>
                     <l>He knows that Vertue doth conſiſt in Action;</l>
                     <l>But ſides not with the giddy-headed Faction.</l>
                     <l>When Wars are done, and bloody Battels ceaſe,</l>
                     <l>His wiſdom is the Rule and Guide of Peace;</l>
                     <l>'Specially if he hath at his command</l>
                     <l>A ſtore of Arms, to arm a needful band.</l>

                     <l>He knows the way to Honour, lies through danger,</l>
                     <l>To which his Mind and Body is no ſtranger.</l>
                     <l>Without him ne'er expect a Victory,</l>
                     <l>But at the foot of enemies to ly.</l>
                     <l>He's Valiant upon all Attempts whatever,</l>
                     <l>Prudent, Conſtant, Faithful; no Deceiver.</l>
                     <l>He will not for a little hurt with-draw;</l>

                     <l>He will not break his Sword againſt a Tree,</l>
                     <l>(Yet ſwear it was againſt an enemy)</l>
                     <l>As Major <hi>C—</hi> did; nor piſtol his Hat,</l>

<hi>Chat:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Nor run his Breeches, nor his Buff-coat through,</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>Nor coin excuſes in a time of War,</l>
                     <l>As hath that Blandiloquious Colonel <hi>R.</hi>

                     <l>Nor counterfeit Morboſity, when well,</l>
                     <l>As that loquacious Coward, Captain <hi>L.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Nor creep into a Ditch, as Captain <hi>A.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Nor from the Battel hitch, as Major <hi>Ba—</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>There's many ſuch, whoſe Valour lies in words,</l>
                     <l>Deſerve to wear (not Ir'n, but) wooden Swords.</l>
                     <l>Nor is he one that's Valiant at a ſpurt;</l>
                     <l>No, no, he's far from being ſuch a flurt.</l>
                     <l>As many Sparks that this hour will be ſtout,</l>
                     <l>But the next, very bravely face about;</l>
                     <l>For they cannot endure a while to ſtand;</l>
                     <l>Nor above all, to Combat hand to hand.</l>
                     <l>But our Commander you ſhall ever find,</l>
                     <l>Of a brave, ſteady, fixed conſtant mind;</l>
                     <l>Yet if he ſees he ſhall be over-power'd,</l>
                     <l>With ten to one, rather than be devour'd,</l>
                     <l>He will (as he muſt needs) ſound a Retreat,</l>
                     <l>As <hi>Scipio, Hannibal, Pompey</hi> the Great,</l>
                     <l>And other Valiant Worthies oft have done,</l>
                     <l>In the ſame caſe, or all been undone.</l>
                     <l>And more ſometimes is done by policy,</l>
                     <l>Than force it ſelf, againſt an Enemy.</l>
                     <l>But there's no power, policy, nor skill,</l>
                     <l>Can once withſtand the Lord of Hoſts his will.</l>
                     <l>Our Hero, to whom I return again,</l>
                     <l>Is one, who did his Country never ſtain:</l>
                     <l>He ne'er was guilty of debauched Crimes;</l>
                     <l>Nor will he change Religion with the Times,</l>
                     <l>As many now; yea, and ſome great ones too,</l>
                     <l>For many <hi>Magnates</hi> any thing will do,</l>
                     <l>To win the favour of the riſing Sun:</l>
                     <l>And when he ſets, they know which way to run:</l>
                     <l>To th' Dev'l, or Tiburn, ſome may go perchance,</l>
                     <l>Others may trot to <hi>Newgate, Rome,</hi> or
<hi>France;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>For knaves have many Subterfuges, where</l>
                     <l>No honeſt Man durſt ever yet appear.</l>
                     <l>But this brave Soul, whoſe Fame I now record,</l>
                     <l>Is always fixt, and faithful to his Word.</l>
                     <l>Let times be what they will, he firmly ſtands,</l>
                     <l>And ready to obey all juſt Commands.</l>
                     <l>He Herds not with the Beaſts of Prey; no, no,</l>
                     <l>His Soul is more Seraphical than ſo.</l>
                     <l>He's no Time-ſerver, no, he's not ſo baſe,</l>
                     <l>As to comply meerly to get a Place.</l>
                     <l>He will not change his Note, nor turn his Coat;</l>
                     <l>No, not although he is left not worth a Groat.</l>
                     <l>While Temporizers turn to ſave their Bacon,</l>
                     <l>Which for <hi>Nathanaels</hi> too too long were taken:</l>
                     <l>For another time hath them diſcover'd all;</l>
                     <l>Yet ſtill are proud and confident withal.</l>
                     <l>Our General is careful that his Men</l>
                     <l>Are not debaucht; for he will now and then,</l>
                     <l>Walk up and down <hi>incognito,</hi> by Night,</l>
                     <l>Among their Tents, and ſometimes in the Light,</l>
                     <l>To hear, and ſee their ſeveral humours; which,</l>
                     <l>They hearing, doth from Oathes reſtrain them much:</l>
                     <l>A Vice, which Souldiers are ſo wedded to,</l>
                     <l>As if the Div'l had taught them ſo to do.</l>
                     <l>Nay, and ſome Captains are as bad, or worſe,</l>
                     <l>Who cannot ſpeak, but they muſt Swear and Curſe,</l>
                     <l>At every trifling, petty Provocation,</l>
                     <l>Whereby they haſt'n their own condemnation.</l>
                     <l>And ſo, like Officers, like Souldiers too;</l>
                     <l>A ſwearing, curſing, rude debauched crew:</l>
                     <l>And ſuch our General cann't endure,</l>
                     <l>Of which he'll rid his Army to be ſure.</l>
                     <l>For towards ſuch, and all Offenders, he</l>
                     <l>Doth carry it with great ſeverity:</l>
                     <l>Knowing if he paſs by ſome hateful Crime,</l>
                     <l>'Twould blaſt his Army, and himſelf in time.</l>
                     <l>Therefore ſtrict Diſcipline he doth obſerve,</l>
                     <l>And ſpareth none that puniſhment deſerve:</l>
                     <l>Whereby good Order he doth always keep,</l>
                     <l>That he might with a quiet Conſcience ſleep.</l>
                     <l>But ſome for writing thus, will call me Whigg,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And I, their Railing value not a Fig.</l>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61958:9"/>
                     <l>He likes not multitudes in Armies; no,</l>
                     <l>Too many will themſelves overthrow.</l>
                     <l>Not above Thirty Thouſand he will have</l>
                     <l>For one Field Army. Numbers ſeldom ſave.</l>
                     <l>Great Multitudes, heaps of confuſion are,</l>
                     <l>No Order keep, but always out of ſquare;</l>
                     <l>So rout themſelves. When on the other hand,</l>
                     <l>A ſmall ſmart Army under good Command,</l>
                     <l>Well Diſciplin'd, well Officer'd to boot,</l>
                     <l>Hath worſted mighty Armies, Horſe and Foot;</l>
                     <l>Of which you'll find enough in Hiſtory;</l>
                     <l>And which my ſelf, for Truth, can teſtify</l>
                     <l>In the late Wars, at many a bloody Fight,</l>
                     <l>In the Three Nations, by Day and Night.</l>
                     <l>Therefore to fear a huge untutor'd Hoſt,</l>
                     <l>(Like that of which <hi>Darius</hi> made his boaſt,)</l>
                     <l>Is unto Cowardice too near a kin,</l>
                     <l>And ſuch, a Victory do ſeldom win.</l>
                     <l>But our brave Hero, whom I now deſcribe,</l>
                     <l>Is none of that exanimated Tribe.</l>
                     <l>He knows, that in great Numbers there may be</l>

                     <l>But be they few or many, good or bad;</l>
                     <l>Yea, as brave Men as ever <hi>Lewis</hi> had,</l>
                     <l>Yet he has ſuch skill, methods, wiles, and ways,</l>
                     <l>Unknown to <hi>France,</hi> even in theſe skilful days:</l>
                     <l>To baffle, or put ſome new trick upon them,</l>

                     <l>His Thoughts on vertuous deeds are daily bent,</l>

                     <l>But to ſuch dirty Deeds he hath no will.</l>

                     <l>Than all his Forces; for he hath in ſtore</l>

                     <l>Keeping his Army cloſe, and out of ſight;</l>

                     <l>And there to ſound and beat alarums, (which,</l>
                     <l>Th'encamped Foe will ſtartle very much;)</l>

                     <l>This makes the Foe bend all his thoughts that way,</l>
                     <l>So he go's onward to begin the Fray:</l>
                     <l>Thinking the adverſe Army all is there;</l>
                     <l>When they, juſt then, are falling on the Reer:</l>

                     <l>For few ſuch Good Commanders can be found.</l>
                     <l>Falſe News, he knows, are dangerous; alſo</l>
                     <l>Counterfeit Letters work an overthrow:</l>

                     <l>(In which he can more ſafely take his flight;)</l>
                     <l>Yet the all-ſeeing providence prevents,</l>

                     <l>And I can partly tell you what they be.</l>
                     <l>He'll ſcatter many Caltraps in the way,</l>
                     <l>Or powder, cover'd with Straw, or Hay:</l>
                     <l>The one will make their Horſes halt, but th'other</l>

                     <l>And turn again, as 'twere in 'ſpite of fate.</l>
                     <l>For deſperation will make Cowards fight,</l>

                  <p>THe Reader may with reaſon demand, why this was not Printed ſooner? the anſwer is, becauſe honeſt <hi>Printers</hi> (for I would not truſt others) durſt not meddle with it in thoſe perillous days, for fear of preſent Trouble, or the future diſpleaſure of a great Man at Court; beſides, I thought beſt deferring it a while, to give people time enough to diſcourſe the <hi>Letter</hi> it ſelf; which, being by this time almoſt forgotten, I therefore publiſh it now, on purpoſe to revive the memory of the <hi>Letter</hi> among us (herewith Re-printed) but eſpecially the honour of that noble Hero the Author of it, though lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. However, His moſt excellent Son and Succeſſor, the preſent Elector, being of the ſame Name with His renowned Father, and Inheritor as well of His noble Vertues, as of his ample territories and other grandities, I thought therefore that it might be of as good uſe, and as much to the purpoſe now as formerly. My deſign being chiefly to record and keep in memory amongſt us, the honour and worth of that illuſtrious, ancient and potent Family, for their great zeal, love to, and care of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> a taſte whereof you have in the aforeſaid Letter, to the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fame and Glory of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi>

                  <head>A LETTER FROM THE Duke of Brandenbourg, To ſeveral Miniſters of STATE; SHEWING His Firm RESOLUTION to Defend the Proteſtant Religion.</head>

                     <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Shall be aware both how and with whom I engage; for through the Conduct of all the Affairs of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſince the Riſe of the War in the year 1672, their ſeveral Projects have been no ſooner formed but betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> being the Aſcendant, both laid a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Deſign, and a total Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, all over <hi>Europe,</hi> influencing moſt Princes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, by a powerful Operation of Money, both from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which is plentifully beſtowed, and was gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61958:25"/> and though the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſeem to carry on ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, being the guidance of many Princes, yet craftily cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Deſigns in the moſt Potent.</p>
                  <p>And I too ſenſibly know, that when I commanded the
<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Forces,</hi> my Deſtruction was levell'd at, by the
<hi>Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Cabal,</hi> by thoſe I Aſſiſted, which cauſed me timely to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore amidſt theſe Diſadvantages, can I promiſe any better Succeſs? I have many Motives to induce my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the ſame Deſign is vigorouſly carrying on, though in a ſeeming
<hi>Peace;</hi> nothing therefore can be of Efficacy to Protect us, till we new model our Affairs, and by a ſtrict, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>Re-union,</hi> and fixt Reſolution to go through the Work, and to make an utter Diſmiſſion of all the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who lie lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Boſoms only to confound us.</p>
                  <p>But, I fear ſome are ſo infatuated by them, as not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue my <hi>Advice</hi> till <hi>Deſolation</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> overtake them: And for my part I will ſtrictly obſerve it my ſelf, and for ever defie their peſtilent Notions, and ſtand upon my Guard, and aſſume the glory, though I be forſaken by all, and chuſe rather to die with the Sword in my Hand, in Defence of my <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> than ſurvive under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of
<hi>France</hi> and Malignancy of <hi>Rome;</hi> for I am ſure in what place ſoever it dilates it ſelf, a <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Miſery</hi> will be brought along with it, both by <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and
<hi>Idolatry.</hi>

                        <l>It did fall out accordingly; although</l>

                        <l>Papiſts, by their Religion, are bound</l>

                        <l>Better die manfully with ſword in hand,</l>
